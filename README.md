# PrintMyName

where code meets creativity in the most unexpected way.

## What's Inside?

At the heart of this repository lies a humble C program, *main.c*, that defies the conventional boundaries of coding. Instead of laboring over data structures lab programs, I decided to start on a journey of self-expression and artistic coding. The result? A name art generator that uses '#' and ' ' (spaces) to form my name!

## Features

- üé® **Artistic Expression**: Who knew code could double as a canvas? Watch as your name comes to life in an elegant arrangement of symbols.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time Management Expertise**: Why focus on lab programs when you can craft a code masterpiece instead?
- üí° **Innovative Problem Solving**: Forget about sorting algorithms and linked lists momentarily. Embrace a new way of thinking and coding.

## Instructions

1. Compile the *main.c* file using your preferred C compiler.
2. Execute the compiled program and witness the magic unfold before your eyes.
3. Share your masterpiece with friends and colleagues who appreciate the finer details of coding and creativity.
